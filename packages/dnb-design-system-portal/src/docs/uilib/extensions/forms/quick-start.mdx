## Quick start

Field components can be used directly as they are, for example `Field.Email`:

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(<Field.Email />)
```

By building an entire form with components from Eufemia and Eufemia Forms, you save time and code:

```jsx
import { Card } from '@dnb/eufemia'
import { Form, Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(
  <Form.Handler
    data={existingData}
    onChange={...}
    onSubmit={...}
  >
    <Card spacing="medium">
      <Field.String
        path="/companyName"
        label="Bedriftens navn"
        required
      />
      <Field.OrganizationNumber
        path="/companyOrganizationNumber"
        required
      />
      <Field.Selection
        path="/postalAddressSelect"
        label="Ã˜nsket sted for tilsendt post"
        variant="radio"
      >
        <Field.Option value="companyAddress" title="Samme som forretningsadresse" />
        <Field.Option value="other" title="Annet" />
      </Field.Selection>
    </Card>
  </Form.Handler>
)
```

### Data handling

You don't need React `useState` to handle your form data.

The form data is handled by the form context and [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/useData/), [getData](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/getData/) and [setData](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/setData/). They lets you access or modify your form data outside of the form context within your application:

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

function MyForm() {
  return <Form.Handler id="unique">...</Form.Handler>
}

function OtherComponent() {
  // Use the data or update one entry at a time
  const { data, update } = Form.useData('unique')
}

// Or use the Form.setData method when ever you need to
Form.setData('unique', { companyName: 'DNB' })
```

### Async form handling

It depends on your use case if this feature is needed. But when it is, its ofter a time consuming task to implement. Eufemia Forms has therefor a built-in feature that enables async form behavior.

More details about the async form behavior can be found in the [async form behavior](/uilib/extensions/forms/getting-started/#async-form-behavior) section.
